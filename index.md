# Power BI Custom Visuals Training

Welcome! This site walks you through a **hands-on workshop** for building a custom Power BI visual using the `pbiviz` tools.

By the end, you'll be able to:

- Explain when custom visuals are useful.
- Scaffold a visual with `pbiviz new`.
- Wire up data roles and mappings in `capabilities.json`.
- Implement simple rendering logic in `visual.ts`.
- Package and import your `.pbiviz` into Power BI.

## How to use this site

- **Trainers:** Use each module as a section in your live session. The “Lab” page is designed to be followed step-by-step.
- **Participants:** You can follow along during the session, then come back here later as a reference.

Pro tip: open the Lab page in one window and your terminal / VS Code / Power BI in another. Fewer alt-tabs, fewer regrets.
